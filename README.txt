That sounds like an awesome concept for a game! "Gorilla Escape" has a lot of potential for dynamic gameplay and storytelling. Let’s break it down a bit and flesh out the core elements:

🎮 Game Overview
Title: Gorilla Escape
Genre: 3D Third-Person Fighting / Action-Adventure / Escape
Main Character: Sergius – a humanoid gorilla with enhanced intelligence, speech, and combat skills.
Objective: Escape the research facility, fight through guards and scientists, and reach the forest to reclaim freedom.
🦍 Main Character: Sergius
Abilities:

Combat: Pole-fighting techniques (light and heavy attacks, combos, special moves).
Agility: Wall climbing, swinging, and vaulting over obstacles.
Stealth: Sneak behind enemies, use environmental objects for silent takedowns.
Primal Rage (Ultimate Ability): Temporarily boosts strength and speed, allowing Sergius to overpower enemies in a berserk state.
Backstory:
Sergius was born in captivity, experimented on by scientists looking to create hyper-intelligent creatures. He learned human language and combat techniques through simulation training. The years of imprisonment and mistreatment fuel his desire to escape and find freedom in the forest, where he believes a hidden gorilla tribe may still exist.

🏚️ Environment Design
The Lab Facility (Starting Area)

High-tech cages, research labs, and security rooms.
Surveillance cameras, laser grids, and patrolling guards.
Environmental interactions: Break glass to trigger alarms, use vents to sneak through rooms, throw objects to distract enemies.
The Outdoor Complex (Mid-Game)

Electric fences, watchtowers, and spotlights.
Guard dogs and armed soldiers with stun weapons.
Vertical platforming elements: Climbing trees, scaling walls, and jumping between buildings.
The Forest (Final Stage)

A vast, dense jungle with both freedom and danger.
Wild predators, hidden ruins, and rival animal tribes.
A final showdown against the lead scientist in a high-tech mech suit.
🥊 Combat System
Basic Attacks: Fast punches, kicks, and pole swings.
Combos: Chain light and heavy attacks for fluid combos.
Block & Parry: Deflect enemy attacks with precise timing.
Special Moves:
Pole Vault Kick – Launch off the pole for a powerful aerial kick.
Ground Slam – Slam the pole into the ground, knocking enemies back.

🧠 Progression & Upgrades
Skill Tree:

Combat Mastery: Unlock new pole techniques and increased damage.
Agility Boost: Faster climbing, longer jumps, and improved evasion.
Primal Instinct: Heightened senses to detect enemies and hidden paths.
Collectibles: Research logs, experiment notes, and gorilla statues scattered across the facility that reveal Sergius’s origins.

🎵 Atmosphere & Music
Soundtrack: A mix of tribal drums and intense, high-tempo action music.
Ambience: Echoes of distant animals, the hum of security systems, and the subtle rustling of leaves in the forest.
